# 📘 Extra LeetCode Solutions

This folder contains all the **LeetCode problems I solve outside the main Striver's Sheet track**.  
It includes:

- **LeetCode Problem of the Day (POTD)**
- Extra/random practice problems
- Contest problems I revisit
- Any question I solve to improve intuition and pattern recognition

---

## 🔍 Purpose

This directory serves as a log of my additional LeetCode practice.  
I use it to:

- Strengthen concepts through extra problems
- Build consistency with daily POTD
- Explore new patterns and edge cases
- Track growth outside structured sheets

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Maintain a clean archive of solved LeetCode questions
- Provide quick reference material for revision
- Document progress beyond sheet-based practice
- Improve accuracy, speed, and reasoning through daily and extra problems

## 🚀 How I Use This Folder

- Update with **POTD** daily
- Add problems solved during contests or random practice
- Experiment with different approaches and compare performance
