## Arrays – Core Patterns

### Two Pointers
- Use when traversing from both ends to check some codition or swap the numbers.
- Example: Move Zeroes, Reverse Array, Palindrome check

### Min-so-far
- Track running minimum and calculate max profit.
- Example: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock

### Kadane’s Algorithm
- For maximum subarray sum problems (subarray must be contiguous).
- Sum is the total of all elements till now and current value.
- Maxi is the maximum of sum and maxi.
- Reset sum to current number if it drops below it.

### Brute Force
- Good for initial understanding; optimize later with patterns.
